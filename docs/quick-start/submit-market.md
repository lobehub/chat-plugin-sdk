## Listing Plugins on Store

If you want your plugin to be used by more people, feel free to [submit it for listing](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat-plugins) on the plugin store.

## ðŸš€ How to Submit a Plugin

Use the `plugin_template.json` to create an entry in the `plugins` directory, write a brief description and tag it appropriately, then create a pull request.

### Submission Steps

1. <kbd>Fork</kbd> this repository
2. Copy the `plugin_template.json`
3. Fill out the copy and rename it appropriately
4. Move it to the `plugins` directory
5. Submit a pull request and wait for review

> ðŸ‘‰ **Note:** The `createAt` date will be automatically filled in after the merge.

## ðŸ‘€ Important Notes

- Plugins must be functional to be included
- If a plugin becomes unavailable or unmaintained, we may redirect it to a branch or remove it from the index
- Not all plugins will be accepted; we will review and evaluate them
- Even if you are not the author, you can submit a plugin, but it's best if the author submits it themselves
- If you wish to remove your plugin or believe the description is incorrect, please submit an issue or pull request
