# Python Server

This document aims to provide guidance for developers interested in using Python to develop LobeChat plugin servers. Currently, we do not have an official Python server template, but we recognize this as an important need and are actively working on it.

## Exploring Python Server Implementation

While there is no official template at the moment, we encourage developers with Python experience to explore server implementation on their own. In the Python ecosystem, there are many excellent web frameworks that can help you quickly build a server, such as Flask, FastAPI, and Django. These frameworks provide powerful tools and flexible designs to help you build efficient and stable server applications.

## We are Actively Working on It

We understand that Python server examples are a crucial resource for the developer community. Therefore, we are working hard to create a Python server example that is easy to understand and use, and we will share it with the community as soon as possible. This example will demonstrate how to receive and process requests from LobeChat plugins using Python, and send responses.

## Contribute Your Template

If you have successfully built a usable Python plugin and are willing to share your experience and achievements with the community, we warmly welcome your contribution. Your template can help other developers get started with Python server development more quickly and make valuable contributions to the LobeChat plugin ecosystem.

Please contact us and submit your template in the following ways:

- Host your project as a GitHub repository and ensure it has a clear README file to guide other developers on how to use it.
- Send us the repository link, and we will review and consider including it in our official documentation.

We look forward to your innovation and contribution, and hope to work together to advance LobeChat plugin development.
